you want to launch this exe instead of the regular one
there is some motion sickness crap in this launcher so in order to turn that off you wanna go into options then go all the way at the bottom for the bird option and then click the screen tilting option and turn off camera tilting (if you dont get motion sick you can keep it on I Don't Give A Shit)
